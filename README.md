woodo
=====

Amusing bash script based on http://as.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/18gpja/so_i_was_messing_around_with_the_terminal/. Adds color and non-root alt text.

To use, place woodo.sh in some path (/YOUR/PATH/TO/woodo.sh), then add the following line in your .bashrc file:
    alias woodo="/YOUR/PATH/TO/woodo.sh"
